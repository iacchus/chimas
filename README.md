# CHIMAS BBS API

**this repository is deprecated, see https://github.com/TryChimas/chimas instead.**

This project has in mind to develop a modularized, extensible and easily maintainable API-based forum, so that it can be used with standalone clients for example: command line interface, tui, telnet and web.
